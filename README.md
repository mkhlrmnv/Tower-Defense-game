# Tower Defense Game

We have built developed our own tower defense game. Game has fully own graphics and a lot of features. Our game has 8 different kinds of enemies and 6 different kinds of towers. Enemies and towers have all their own animations when attacking, moving or dying. Game has money system where player gets cash by surviving rounds, player can use that cash to buy new towers or to upgrade existing ones. Also, there is mechanic where damage between towers and enemies depends on objects type and on the type of object that itâ€™s attacking
